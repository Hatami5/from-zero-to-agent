##  Overview

**From Zero to Agent** is a step-by-step hands-on learning and experimentation repository that explores how to build **AI Agents** from scratch.  
Each unit in this repo demonstrates real-world examples using modern frameworks like:

- 🧩 **smolagents** — lightweight and fast agents for experimentation  
- 📚 **LlamaIndex** — connect agents to knowledge and data (RAG)  
- 🔗 **LangGraph** — build multi-agent workflows and complex reasoning systems  

>  Goal: Learn, build, and deploy your own AI agents while mastering real-world frameworks.
